My Cool Expense Tracker
Problem

Sometimes it’s hard to know where your money goes. People forget what they spent or spend too much on some things. I wanted to make keeping track of money easy and fun.

Solution

This project lets you put in what you buy every day. It tells you what kind of stuff you spend your money on and shows pictures (charts) so you can see your spending. It even gives tips to save money!

Tools

Languages: Python, JavaScript

Helpers (Libraries): Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask

Data: Things people bought

Optional Smart Stuff: A small AI that guesses what you spent money on

Results - Output Screenshot

It works! You can see your money in different groups like “Snacks,” “Toys,” or “Games,” and it makes cool charts to show your spending.
